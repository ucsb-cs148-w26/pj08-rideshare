Hi my name is Anna and I am a third-year computer science student from the Bay Area.

My idea for the project is to make a carpooling app for UCSB students where students who have a car can help other students in the community out without cars. Students can organize carpools to the grocery store, nearby locations, or even long drives home. This is a good way for students without cars to make transportation more accessible while giving students with cars opportunities to make some money while helping others.
