# Team Learning Plan

Our team is building a mobile application using **React Native**, with a backend based on **Node.js** and **Firebase**. This document describes our current skills, gaps, and how we will learn what we need during Weeks 3 and 4.

---

## 1. Team Strengths

Our team brings strong experience across full-stack development, databases, and backend systems.

- **Moiez** has full-stack experience using React and C#, with strong frontend fundamentals and a solid foundation for expanding into mobile and backend development.

- **Hien** has extensive experience in React, MongoDB, Firebase, and Node.js, giving the team a strong backend and data foundation.

- **Ruben** is comfortable across frontend and backend with React, Node.js, and MongoDB, providing reliable full-stack support.

- **Joel** has full-stack experience and is focused on integrating React Native with backend services and Firebase.

- **Anna** brings broad programming experience and a strong foundation in data and databases, with a focus on developing frontend and user-facing features.

- **Kenisha** already has experience building mobile apps with React Native and Firebase, making her a key resource for UI and mobile architecture.

- **Tanvi** has a strong background in Python, machine learning, and data systems, including MongoDB and Pinecone, with experience in React and Node.js for web applications.

### Strategic Pairing

- Strong-style pairing will be used when needed, with teammates with more familiarity with a technology/task work alongside teammates who are newer to that concept.

## 2. Knowledge Gaps

The main areas where the team needs to grow are:

- React Native and mobile-specific development  
- End-to-end integration between mobile UI and backend  
- Mobile deployment and platform-specific behavior  
- Coordinating Firebase with React Native  

Most team members are experienced in web development, but mobile app development is new for several people.

- Connect mobile app to backend and Firebase.
- Test full **end-to-end workflows**.

### Anna
- Implement **UI components and user-facing features**.
- Connect UI to backend data.
- Improve layout and usability.

### Kenisha
- Build and refine **core React Native UI components**.
- Help integrate frontend and backend.
- Ensure **UI consistency and mobile best practices** are followed.

## 5. Breadth and Depth Strategy

- **Breadth:**  
  Every team member will build baseline competency in:
  - React Native
  - Basics of mobile app development 
  - Understanding how the frontend connects to backend services and databases

- **Depth:**  
  The team will use a divide-and-conquer approach so that:
  - Some members develop deeper expertise in **mobile UI, navigation, and layout**
  - Some focus on **backend services and databases**
  - Some focus on **frontend–backend integration and data flow**

This allows us to move quickly while ensuring that no part of the stack becomes a single point of failure. It also allows people to gain experience in the areas that they are less familiar with.
