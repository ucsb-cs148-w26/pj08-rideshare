# Problem Scenario

## Background

Many UCSB students rely on transportation beyond campus, such as trips to Isla Vista, downtown Santa Barbara, airports (SBA, LAX), or nearby cities. Existing transportation options like Uber, Lyft, or public transit can be expensive, inconvenient, or poorly suited for student schedules.

At the same time, many students already drive these routes and would be willing to share rides to reduce costs, help others, and make some money on the side.

## The Problem

Current ridesharing solutions present several challenges for UCSB students:

- **High cost** of commercial rideshare services
- **Lack of trust** when riding with or offering rides to strangers outside the UCSB community
- **Inefficient coordination**, relying on group chats, Facebook groups, campus clubs, word of mouth, or scattered social media posts
- **Limited student-focused features**, such as campus-specific destinations and schedules

As a result, students either overpay for transportation or miss opportunities to share rides efficiently.

## Target Users

The target users are UCSB students with valid `@ucsb.edu` email addresses who:
- Need reliable and affordable transportation
- Are willing to offer or share rides within the UCSB community

---

## Proposed Solution

The UCSB Rideshare App addresses these issues by providing:
- A **UCSB-only ridesharing platform** restricted to `@ucsb.edu` authentication
- A simple way for users to **post rides** or **find available rides**
- A trusted environment limited to verified UCSB affiliates
- A centralized, campus-focused solution for ride coordination

By leveraging shared community trust and student needs, the app reduces costs, improves accessibility, and simplifies transportation for UCSB affiliates.
