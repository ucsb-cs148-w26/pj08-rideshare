# Date of Retrospective: 01/23/25 

* Led by: Tanvi Ladha  
* Present: Ruben Alvarez-Gutierrez, Moiez Baqar, Anna Gornyitzki, Hien Huynh, Tanvi Ladha, Joel Sanchez, Kenisha Vaswani
* Absent: Wyatt Hamabe (provided his bullets via message due to attendance conflict) 

## Start 
* Test before approving a PR and/or have two people approve it 
* Skim lab document before coming to section  
* Provide screenshot of the emulated code and add that to PR so whoever is testing it can see what it's supposed to look like  

## Stop 
* Stop committing temporary code and comments, make sure to clean it up before pushing 

## Continue 
* Group chat is a great resource for quick communication - keep sending notifications, PR reminders, etc. through there 
* This level of responsiveness and communication has been working well for attendance conflicts as well as project updates. 

## Action item 

* Goal: pushing clean code with readable, useful comments and ensuring temporary code/comments have been removed. 
* Experiment: ensure that from now on, PRs have double approval before being committed.  
* Measurable action item: ensure that each team member has skimmed the lab document prior to section. 

* Keep up this level of communication and responsiveness in the groupchat! 

## Retro Assessment 
This retro used the start, stop, continue outline. This three part framework helped keep it simple, allowing each member to stay on task during the discussion. It was an easy outline to follow and most of their concerns and positives fit well with this framework. As the discussion moved and each person shared, most shared items got many nods to new ideas people shared. The discussion was helpful, civil, and the team agreed on all shared improvements. We have measurable goals that we plan to work towards for our next sprint. I would advise the next retro leader to continue with this outline as it keeps the discussion moving, people resonate with what others share while giving members the opportunity to agree/disagree with each other when necessary. I would also say that during the next retro, the leader may be able to ask more guiding/follow up questions to enhance the discussion. 

## Experiment/Change 
We have agreed to try to have each PR approved by at least 2 people before being committed. We will evaluate how many PRs have 2 people approving and if that results in cleaner code being pushed with less concerns during the next retro.

## Experiment Results - UPDATED 1/30/2026
By 1/30/2026 we completed all user stories required for our MVP. Each user story and subtask has been marked as completed in our KanBan board. Since the date of our retrospective (1 week prior to today), we have attempted to have at least 2 people approve each PR. This week, as we moved fast to complete our MVP, almost 95% of our PRs were approved by 2 people. We found this change in our workflow to add a little bit of extra time in approving PRs but this additional time was worth it as we felt more secure in the code we were pushing to our main branch. Additionally, the team did a great job being responsive and handling PRs in a timely manner. We plan to keep this as part of our general team workflow.
