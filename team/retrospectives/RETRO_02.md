## Retro Assessment 
This retro continued to use the start, stop, continue outline. It kept it simple, with very similar communication as the previous retro, so it went pretty smoothly. Every member stayed on task w/ sharing and listening and resulted in actionable items for the team to move forward with.

## Experiment/Change 
Adding acceptance criteria to user stories/subtasks on kanban, so that we can test edge cases and preemptively fight bugs
